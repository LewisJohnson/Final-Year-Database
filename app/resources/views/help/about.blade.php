<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This software manages project selection and allocation for final year students in the Informatics Department at the University of Sussex
<br><br>
Final year projects are managed by a member of staff, the Project Coordinator, by means of a system that endeavours to match student and supervisor requirements. Supervisors can propose projects that students can accept and, additionally, students can propose their own projects either generally or to a specific supervisor.
<br><br>
The current system had not been maintained for several years and was in need of updating. This update took the form of adding new functionality and a general overhaul of both look and feel. The updating of capabilities due to advances in software and browser technologies has also been addressed.
<br><br>
As the system runs on the departmentâ€™s web servers it has been written using available technologies such as PHP and MySQL.
<br><br>
It has been produced in 2008/2009 as a final year project by David Thomas under the supervision of Bernhard Reus.
<br><br>
The system has been improved further by David Thomas and Bernhard Reus during 2010-11.
