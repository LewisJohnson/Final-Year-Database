	'about' =>
		'This software manages project selection and allocation for final year and masters students at the University of Sussex. 
		<br><br>
		Final year and masters projects are managed by a member of staff, the Project Coordinator, by means of a system that endeavours to match student and supervisor requirements. Supervisors can propose projects that students can accept and, additionally, students can propose their own projects either generally or to a specific supervisor. 
		<br><br>
		The current system had not been maintained for several years and needed updating. This update took the form of adding new functionality and a general overhaul of both look and feel. The updating of capabilities due to advances in software and browser technologies has also been addressed. 
		<br><br>
		This website is hosted by the department of Engineering and Informatics. It was written using Laravel, MySQL and other technologies. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/lewisJohnson/Final-Year-Database">on Github.</a> 
		<br><br>
		This website was created in 2017/2018 as a final year project by <a href="http://www.lewisdavidjohnson.com">Lewis Johnson</a> under the supervision of <a href="mailto:bernhard@sussex.ac.uk">Dr. Bernhard Reus.</a>',
