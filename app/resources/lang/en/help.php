	// About
	'about' => "This software manages project selection and allocation for final year and masters students in the Informatics Department at the University of Sussex.
				<br><br>
				Final year projects are managed by a member of staff, the Project Coordinator, by means of a system that endeavours to match student and supervisor requirements. Supervisors can propose projects that students can accept and, additionally, students can propose their own projects either generally or to a specific supervisor.
				<br><br>
				The current system had not been maintained for several years and was in need of updating. This update took the form of adding new functionality and a general overhaul of both look and feel. The updating of capabilities due to advances in software and browser technologies has also been addressed.
				<br><br>
				As the system runs on the departmentâ€™s web servers it has been written using available technologies such as PHP and MySQL.
				<br><br>
				It has been produced in 2017/2018 as a final year project by <a href='http://www.lewisdavidjohnson.com'>Lewis Johnson</a> under the supervision of Bernhard Reus.",
